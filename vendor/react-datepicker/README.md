This is a built and checked in version of a fork of react datepicker.
It exists to resolve this issue https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/issues/743
The commit is https://github.com/Amauris/react-datepicker/tree/dd3ca7147fa0e07d47e679de95196147efe100ed
Once https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/pull/825 is merged we should revert back to npm installing datepicker
